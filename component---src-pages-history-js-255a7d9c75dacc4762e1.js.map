We received funding from our school, John Fraser\n            SS, to purchase our first Cortex system, and found space in one of\n            our technology classrooms to hold meetings. This room became our\n            home for years to come! <br />\n            <br />\n            Almost everyone was new to VEX, which made the year a great learning\n            opportunity. With some amazing members, we were able to build a\n            robot during lunch breaks and after school sessions thanks to our\n            amazing teacher supervisors (Ms. McEwen and Mr. Lightbody). After\n            the holidays, our first robot was ready to compete. <br />\n            <br />\n            With the robot complete, the team was able to attend our first\n            competition, the iDesign Central Toronto Qualifying event. We won 3\n            out of 7 matches, ranking 30th out of 60 teams - a great learning\n            experience once again! We were unable to attend our other registered\n            event, and with that, our season came to a close. <br />\n            <br />\n            Many of our members graduated that year, leaving 2 to continue with\n            the team. As such, the team had to expand and rebuild the following\n            year.\n          </Text>\n\n          <br />\n          <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\">\n            2018/19 Turning Point\n          </Heading>\n          <Text fontSize=\"sm\">\n            Turning Point was our second season in competition, and we brought\n            on several new members at the beginning of this year, many of whom\n            are still on the team today. Once again, we only had one team\n            (82050A), and the season was a great learning opportunity for all\n            members. <br />\n            <br />\n            This year we kept a similar schedule for our meetings with our\n            teacher supervisors, but were also able to take it home over our\n            winter holidays to work on it while school was off. Our strategist\n            Rishabh and his family were gracious enough to host meetings at\n            their home so we were able to get even more hands on working time\n            with the robot than in the first year. <br />\n            <br />\n            We competed in two events in February: the Brampton Robotics VRC\n            Qualifying event, and the iDesign Central Toronto VRC Qualifying\n            Event. Unfortunately, we were not able to win any matches at our\n            first event in Brampton but we took the time until the next\n            competition to make improvements, leading to our first ever\n            elimination selection at Central Toronto.\n            <br />\n            <br /> This being the first season for the majority of our team\n            members, it was a great formative experience. We learned a lot about\n            the robotics design process and were eager to continue improving\n            into the next season.\n          </Text>\n\n          <br />\n          <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\">\n            2019/20 Tower Takeover\n          </Heading>\n          <Text fontSize=\"sm\">\n            A lot of things changed for our club during the Tower Takeover\n            season. Our school was able to fund the purchase of a V5 system,\n            giving our team new technology to build our robots after competing\n            in the last season with cortex. This was also the inaugural season\n            for our second team, 82050B. As such, both 82050A and 82050B were\n            going to compete. Once again, we were able to run thanks to our\n            amazing teacher supervisors: Ms. McEwen and Mr. Lightbody.\n            <br />\n            <br /> With a better understanding of the design process, our older\n            members were able to teach new members based on their experiences.\n            This allowed us to run teaching sessions so that knowledge could be\n            passed on. Both teams were able to CAD their robots and iteratively\n            improve in order to be successful.\n            <br />\n            <br /> With both teams working throughout the season on their bots,\n            we were able to compete at multiple competitions. Both teams\n            competed at Appleby College event, with 82050A also competing at the\n            St. Catherines regional and Collingwood qualifier. Due to their\n            skills score, 82050A was able to qualify for the Ontario Provincial\n            Championship, with it being the first time the school club had\n            attended.\n            <br />\n            <br /> After further refining of the bot, 82050A competed at the\n            Provincial championship and won 5/7 qualifying matches. As such,\n            they successfully made it to eliminations! After a great run, the\n            team lost a close match in the R-16 round, meaning that the season\n            had come to an end.\n            <br />\n            <br /> This season was an amazing experience for all members, being\n            the most successful year so far. Our members were more excited than\n            ever for the new season.\n          </Text>\n\n          <br />\n          <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\">\n            2020/21 Change Up\n          </Heading>\n          <Text fontSize=\"sm\">\n            With the COVID-19 pandemic still ongoing, the Change Up season has\n            been very different for us. We were unable to have run both teams\n            due to gathering restrictions, so only 82050A will be competing this\n            year. Instead, our senior members are using the time to teach new\n            members the fundamentals of building, programming, and the design\n            process so that they are better equipped for the next year, while\n            simultaneously building a robot for 82050A. Our team is also very\n            thankful for our new teacher supervisor, Mr. Ghorvei, who has been\n            hosting socially-distanced meetings for us in the tech classrooms of\n            our school where we have been working on building a DIY perimeter\n            kit. <br />\n            <br />\n            Until this season, we had gotten by without one, but due to the\n            online nature of most competitions this year, our team needed a\n            perimeter in order to record and post skills runs. With funding from\n            our school and an enormous amount of help from Mr. Ghorvei, we were\n            able to build a functional perimeter out of wooden planks that\n            satisfy REC requirements. Now we can compete in online events as\n            well as practice skills in a proper environment. <br />\n            <br />\n            To make sure we were ready for competitions, our dedicated team\n            members on 82050A brought the parts and tools home with them and\n            worked on their own time to build and program a high quality robot.\n            After passing the robot from person to person, to make sure many\n            people can get involved while still adhering to COVID-19 guidelines,\n            we’ve built what we believe to be the best robot in our program\n            history. We are incredibly excited to compete in the coming weeks,\n            whether online or physically. <br />\n            <br />\n            82050A is currently registered to compete in an in-person\n            skills-only event on December 12, 2020 (the Caution Tape Classic),\n            and an online skills competition (Maple Leaf Qualifying) on January\n            14.\n          </Text>\n        </Box>\n      </Center>\n\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <center>\n        <Footer data={data} year={year} />\n      </center>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default HistoryPage\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/vextimeline-e75bb22b57ef8664213ff7850c7267c6.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
