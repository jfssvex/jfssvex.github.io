Teams\n          build a robot with provided VEX parts and program it to run through a\n          course and complete objectives, such as throwing a ball in a hoop or\n          stacking cubes into towers and cups. Each challenge allows students to\n          expand their knowledge within the domains of engineering, design,\n          programming, and of course, teamwork! For VRC specifically, high\n          school and middle school students are able to compete with their built\n          robots. For younger students, VEX-IQ is available, and for\n          post-secondary students, VEXU is available.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          VEX is an excellent learning opportunity for students - just ask our\n          team members! Building a robot from the ground up with your team\n          teaches you to think critically and learn much more about design.\n          Students get to become part of a team working towards the same\n          objective, building tight-knit bonds and friendships with their\n          teammates. Participating in competitions with your team is also an\n          excellent experience, allowing members to meet other individuals who\n          are passionate for STEM.\n        </Text>\n        <br />\n\n        <Text as=\"a\" href=\"https://www.vexrobotics.com/\">\n          Learn more at the VEX robotics website.{\" \"}\n        </Text>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <br />\n\n        <SimpleGrid columns={2} spacing={10}>\n          <Box>\n            <Image\n              src=\"https://www.vexrobotics.com/media/wysiwyg/VRC-ChangeUp-Comp_2.jpg\"\n              alt=\"Game Zone\"\n            />\n          </Box>\n          <Box>\n            <Heading as=\"h4\" size=\"md\">\n              2020-2021 Game\n            </Heading>\n            <br />\n            <Text>\n              VEX Robotics Competition Change Up is played on a 12’x12’ square\n              field configured as seen above.
